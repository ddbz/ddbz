    <h3>It's me... Jordan</h3>

    <p>I love solving problems. Putting the pieces together. When they come together just right... <span class="sprout">**BOOM!**</span> ...They become more than the sum of the parts.</p> 

    <p>Do you know the device that's currently connecting you to me is over a million times more powerful than the ones that sent man to the moon? Let me help you make better use of it. Do you have something you'd like to launch? An idea? A business? <a href="#">Just pick up the phone.</a></p> 
    
    <p>I design and build digital solutions that make real life better. I do:</p>

    <p>Design is what brings it, and us, all together. It solves big problems by merging knowledge and tools, ideas and people, the hardware and the software. It's about putting a deadline on a dream, and drawing our map from A to B.</p> 

    <p>A is where you and I get to know each other. Grab coffee, talk shop. Get a sense of where your B might be. And why you're determined to get there. If you're anything like me, your map has all kinds of squiggly lines with big red Xs and vast swaths of uncharted territory. The internet is a bit like the wild west. There's a lot to learn, and some things worth looking out for. Let me be your guide. I'll help you get from A to B, and maybe we can start charting a course to Z. I bring big picture thinking, a clear collaborative process, and an arsenal of skills that'll help us blow through any obstacles along the way.</p>

    <h3>rhymes w/ beets</h3>

    <p>It's my name. Don't worry, you won't wear it out, but say it right.</p> 

    <p>A bit unusual, I know. But that's me. I'm a pretty unusual guy. And I bring an unusually diverse set of skills to my work.</p>

    <p>I've been smashing things apart and putting them back together since I was a kid. That's how I learn. We had this sweet little workshop in the basement growing up, decked out with all kinds of dangerous tools. I went from fixing toaster ovens to building (and crashing) bikes. If my ass wasn't bouncing on a bike seat, it was often firmly planted in front of a screen. My big bro and I grew up geeks and gamers.</p> 
    
    <p>I'm at home on the command line. I'm an adept wordsmith with a passion for pushing pixels. I've been a published photographer and a 3D modeler. In college I stretched my delicate wings with a year each in Spain and Denmark, grabbing an engineering degree along the way. I immediately landed what I considered a dream job working at a local bike startup. From there I moved to Vermont, grew a gnarly beard, and spent a few blissful years at an architectural design/build school, slinging huevos and hot meat sandwiches on the side. It was there that I developed a lens for the big picture, and came to see that I'm at my best when I bring all my seemingly disparate skills together.</p> 

    <p>That we are at our collective best when we know how to come together, and collaborate. That gave me an idea. In 2010, my brain packed tight and percolating, I called up my best friend and asked him to build an education platform with me. It was an incredible ride. Tech has been my jam ever since.</p>

    <p>I'm good at working with tight constraints and I place high value on time. When that time is up I unplug. I'm a new dad in a new old home in Western Mass. I like to play outside. I'm usually in bed by nine.</p>
